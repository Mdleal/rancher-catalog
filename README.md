# rancher-catalog

This is a custom Rancher catalog build for use with [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io); specifically I tried to keep this as easy to use as possible so that you can get Home Assistant up and running as fast and as easily as possible.  So these configs are stripped down to be either (1) self contained, or (2) just using the defaults for the app.
